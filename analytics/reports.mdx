## Overview

Journey's reporting system transforms raw transactional data into actionable business insights. The platform includes 8 pre-built reports covering critical business metrics, with the ability to create custom reports using simple SQL queries.

## Why Reports Matter

Reports provide the data-driven insights needed to:

- **Optimize revenue**: Identify high-value customer segments and products
- **Reduce churn**: Track dunning subscriptions and payment failures before they become cancellations
- **Improve operations**: Monitor delivery performance and fulfillment efficiency
- **Recover revenue**: Reach out to abandoned cart customers with targeted campaigns
- **Forecast growth**: Analyze subscription signup trends and customer lifetime value

## Overview Dashboard

The Overview page serves as your merchant dashboard home, providing real-time business metrics and customer activity monitoring. This single-page view gives you immediate visibility into subscription health, revenue trends, and customer behavior.

<Info>
Access the Overview dashboard immediately after logging into your merchant portal. All metrics update in real-time as customers interact with your business.
</Info>

### Key Metrics

The Overview dashboard shows three important numbers at the top:

**Active Subscriptions** - How many customers are currently active

**Average Deliveries per Subscription** - How often your customers are ordering (higher = better retention)

**Lifetime Value** - Average revenue per active subscription

<Tip>
Track your lifetime value (LTV) compared to customer acquisition cost (CAC). Healthy subscription businesses have an LTV:CAC ratio of 3:1 or higher.
</Tip>

### Live Activity Feed

- New signups

## Requesting Custom Reports

The built-in reports cover most common use cases, but you might need something specific to your business.

### When to Request a Custom Report

You should request a custom report if you need to:
- **Analyze specific customer segments** - e.g., "Show me all customers who paused their subscription in the last 30 days"
- **Track unusual metrics** - e.g., "Show customers with the longest average time between purchases"
- **Monitor performance** - e.g., "Weekly report of churn rate by subscription type"
- **Financial analysis** - e.g., "Revenue by postal code" or "Payment success rates by payment method"
- **Operational insights** - e.g., "Orders that failed delivery twice"

### What to Include in Your Request

When requesting a custom report, provide:

1. **Report name** - What you want to call it (e.g., "High-Value Customers")
2. **Data you need** - What columns or information matter (e.g., customer name, total spent, last purchase date)
3. **Filters** - Any conditions to narrow results (e.g., only customers with 5+ purchases, or only from last 90 days)
4. **How often** - Do you need this once, weekly, or ongoing?
5. **Export format** - Usually Excel, but let us know if different

### Example Request
