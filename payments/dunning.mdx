title: "Dunning & Payment Recovery"
description: "Intelligent payment retry system that recovers failed subscription payments while maintaining positive customer relationships."
---

## Overview

Journey's dunning system automatically handles failed subscription payments through intelligent retry logic, delivery rescheduling, and customer communication. The system is designed to maximize payment recovery rates while minimizing customer friction and churn.

<Info>
  **Dunning** (from German "mahnen" - to remind) is the process of communicating with customers to recover failed payments. Journey automates this entire workflow.
</Info>

## Why Dunning Matters

Payment failures are inevitable in subscription businesses:

- **Credit cards expire** - Average card lifespan is 2-3 years
- **Insufficient funds** - Temporary account balance issues
- **Bank declines** - Fraud prevention systems, spending limits
- **Technical errors** - Network timeouts, processor issues

**Without dunning:**

- 20-30% of subscriptions would churn unnecessarily
- Lost revenue from otherwise happy customers
- No recovery mechanism for temporary issues

**With Journey's dunning:**

- 70-80% of failed payments successfully recover (companies with mature dunning processes)\*
- Automated communication keeps customers informed
- Delivery rescheduling prevents waste and maintains satisfaction

## Subscription Statuses

Journey uses five subscription statuses to manage the dunning lifecycle:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="ACTIVE - Successful Payments">
    **Description:** Subscription is in good standing with successful payment.

    **Triggers:**

    - New subscription created with successful payment
    - Failed payment successfully retries and settles
    - Customer updates payment method and payment succeeds

    **System Behavior:**

    - Future deliveries scheduled normally
    - Payment charged according to billing frequency
    - No retry attempts needed

    **Customer Experience:** Seamless - customer receives deliveries as expected.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="PAST_DUE - Insufficient Funds">
    **Description:** Payment failed due to insufficient funds (response code 51).

    **Triggers:**

    - Payment processor returns "insufficient funds" error code
    - Typically temporary - customer may receive paycheck soon

    **System Behavior:**

    - Delivery rescheduled to next available date
    - Daily retry attempts (or as configured)
    - Email notification on first failure
    - Reminder email every 4th retry attempt

    **Key Difference from ERROR:**

    - Past due indicates a **temporary** issue (no money right now)
    - More lenient retry schedule
    - Higher recovery rate (70-80%)

    **Customer Experience:**

    - Receives friendly reminder email: "Payment didn't go through, we'll try again"
    - Delivery automatically moved to avoid waste
    - No service interruption if payment succeeds within retry window
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="ERROR - Card/Bank Decline">
    **Description:** Payment failed due to card error, bank decline, or processor issue.

    **Triggers:**

    - Expired credit card
    - Card reported lost/stolen
    - Bank fraud detection
    - Payment processor errors

    **System Behavior:**

    - Delivery rescheduled to next available date
    - Daily retry attempts (or as configured)
    - Email notification on first failure: "Please update payment method"
    - Reminder email every 4th retry attempt
    - More urgent tone than PAST_DUE

    **Key Difference from PAST_DUE:**

    - Indicates **customer action needed** (update payment method)
    - Lower automatic recovery rate (20-30%)
    - Requires customer intervention for resolution

    **Customer Experience:**

    - Receives email with link to update payment method
    - Clear call-to-action to prevent cancellation
    - Delivery held until payment resolves
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="EXPIRED - Max Retries Exceeded">
    **Description:** Payment failed for maximum number of attempts. Subscription cancelled.

    **Triggers:**

    - Settling attempts reaches the merchant's max retry threshold (typically 20)
    - No successful payment after retry period (typically 20 days)

    **System Behavior:**

    - Subscription marked as expired
    - Future deliveries cancelled
    - Final notification email sent
    - Payment attempts cease
    - Stock unreserved for all failed orders

    **Reconciliation:**

    - If customer wants to reactivate, they must create a new subscription
    - Old subscription remains in EXPIRED state for record-keeping

    **Customer Experience:**

    - Receives final cancellation email
    - Account suspended until new subscription created
    - Can restart anytime with updated payment method

    <Warning>
      Once a subscription reaches EXPIRED status, it cannot be reactivated. The customer must create a new subscription with a valid payment method.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="ON_HOLD - Customer Paused">
    **Description:** Customer voluntarily paused their subscription.

    **Triggers:**

    - Customer clicks "Pause Subscription" in customer portal
    - Temporary hold for vacation, travel, etc.

    **System Behavior:**

    - No payment attempts made
    - Future deliveries cancelled automatically
    - No dunning emails sent
    - Subscription remains paused until customer resumes

    **Key Difference:** This is **customer-initiated**, not payment-related. No dunning logic applies.

    **Customer Experience:**

    - Full control to pause and resume
    - No charges while paused
    - Easy reactivation when ready
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Intelligent Retry Logic

Journey's dunning system adapts retry behavior based on the type of payment failure and whether the order has already been delivered.

### Daily Retry Schedule

<Steps>
  <Step title="Respectful Retry Timing">
    Retries are scheduled during configured business hours (default: after 8 AM local time) to avoid charging customers in the middle of the night and to align with your customer service availability. You can customize the retry window to match your business needs.
  </Step>
  <Step title="One Attempt Per Day">
    The system attempts to retry a failed payment only once per day. This limits processor fees and prevents customers from seeing multiple charges in quick succession.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automatic Rescheduling">
    If an order hasn't been delivered yet when a payment fails, the system automatically reschedules it to the next available delivery window based on the customer's location and your delivery schedule.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Retry Charge">
    The system attempts to charge the customer's payment method again with the retry.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Understanding Payment Failures

The system intelligently classifies payment failures into two categories, each requiring a different response:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Temporary Issues (PAST_DUE)">
    **What triggers this category:**

    - Insufficient funds in the account
    - Card temporarily declined by the bank
    - A temporary processing issue

    **Why it matters:**

    - These are usually temporary problems the customer may not even realize they have
    - High probability of recovery with a simple retry
    - The customer is often aware of the issue (low balance) and may resolve it themselves
    - These represent pure revenue recovery opportunities

    **What happens:** The system marks the subscription as "past due" and will continue retrying over the following days until the payment succeeds or the retry period expires.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Customer Action Required (ERROR)">
    **What triggers this category:**

    - Card has expired or is no longer valid
    - Card was lost or stolen
    - Fraud protection system blocked the charge
    - Payment method information is incomplete or incorrect

    **Why it matters:**

    - These require the customer to take action (update their card information)
    - Without customer intervention, these won't resolve automatically
    - These represent customers who want to stay but need help

    **What happens:** The system marks the subscription as "error" and sends alerts to the customer so they can update their payment information. This is where proactive customer communication is critical to retention.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Retry Attempt Limits

The system tracks how many times it has attempted to collect payment for each order. This prevents infinite retry loops while giving customers multiple opportunities to resolve their payment issues.

**How It Works:**

- Each retry attempt is logged and counted
- After reaching the maximum number of attempts (default: 20 attempts, configurable per business), the system stops retrying
- When the retry limit is reached, the subscription is marked as "expired" and cancelled
- A final cancellation notification is automatically sent to the customer

**Business Configuration:** You can customize the maximum number of retry attempts to match your business strategy. Typically, businesses set this between 15-25 attempts, balancing:

- **More attempts** = Higher recovery rate, but longer customer experience limbo
- **Fewer attempts** = Faster resolution, but may lose recoverable payments

This threshold protects your business from perpetual retry loops while still giving customers a fair window to resolve their payment issues.

## Customer Communication Strategy

Journey automatically sends emails at key points in the dunning lifecycle to keep customers informed and drive payment resolution.

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Technical Implementation

### Automated Cron Job

The dunning system runs via the `payment_for_delivery.py` management command, executed daily by cron.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Cron Schedule">
    Typically runs once per day in the morning (8-9 AM) to align with retry window.

    ```bash
    # /etc/cron.d/journey-dunning
    0 8 * * * root cd /app && python manage.py payment_for_delivery
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Multi-Tenant Execution">
    Processes all tenants sequentially, with tenant-context isolation.

    ```python
    tenants = get_tenant_model().objects.all().exclude(schema_name='public')
    
    for tenant in tenants:
        with tenant_context(tenant):
            # Process past_due subscriptions
            process_deliveries_with_past_due_subscription_status()
    
            # Process error subscriptions
            process_deliveries_with_error_subscription_status()
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Error Handling">
    Failures logged to Sentry and `/var/log/cron.log`. Individual tenant failures don't stop other tenants from processing.

    ```python
    try:
        process_deliveries_with_error_subscription_status()
    except Exception as e:
        sentry_sdk.capture_exception(e)
        log.write(f"[{tenant.schema_name}] Dunning failed: {e}\n")
        # Continue to next tenant
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Processing Functions

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="PAST_DUE Processing">
    **Function:** `process_deliveries_with_past_due_subscription_status_and_failed_payment_status()`

    **Query Filters:**

    - Subscription status: `ACTIVE` or `PAST_DUE`
    - Payment status: `FAILED`
    - Date range: Last 30 days to +14 days ahead
    - Not cancelled

    **Logic Flow:**

    1. Check if already retried today → Skip if yes
    2. If delivery already completed → Retry payment
    3. If delivery not completed → Reschedule to next date, then retry
    4. If max attempts reached → Set to `EXPIRED`
    5. Every 4th attempt → Send reminder email

    ```python
    def process_delivery_item(delivery_item):
        payment = delivery_item.payment_id
    
        # Skip if already tried today
        if payment.last_attempt.date() == today:
            return
    
        # Reschedule if not delivered
        if not delivery_item.delivered:
            delivery_item.delivery_date = find_next_delivery_date(
                postal_code=customer.postal_code,
                from_date=today
            )
            delivery_item.save()
    
        # Attempt payment
        charge_for_delivery(delivery_item)
    
        # Check for expiration
        if payment.settling_attempts >= merchant.dunning_settling_attempts:
            subscription.status = 'EXPIRED'
            subscription.save()
            send_expiration_email()
    
        # Reminder every 4 attempts
        elif payment.settling_attempts % 4 == 0:
            send_reminder_email()
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="ERROR Processing">
    **Function:** `process_deliveries_with_error_subscription_status()`

    **Query Filters:**

    - Subscription status: `ERROR`
    - Payment status: `FAILED` or `NEW_CHARGE`
    - Not cancelled

    **Logic Flow:**

    1. Check if already retried today → Skip if yes
    2. If delivery already completed → Retry payment
    3. If delivery not completed → Reschedule to next date, then retry
    4. Exactly at max attempts → Set to `EXPIRED` (not \>=, exactly ==)
    5. Every 4th attempt → Send urgent reminder email

    **Key Differences from PAST_DUE:**

    - More urgent email tone
    - No date range filter (process all ERROR subscriptions)
    - Exact match on max attempts (not \>=)

    ```python
    def process_delivery_item(delivery_item):
        payment = delivery_item.payment_id
    
        # Skip if already tried today
        if payment.last_attempt.date() == today:
            return
    
        # Reschedule if needed and charge
        if not delivery_item.delivered:
            delivery_item.delivery_date = find_next_delivery_date(
                postal_code=customer.postal_code,
                from_date=today
            )
            delivery_item.save()
    
        charge_for_delivery(delivery_item)
    
        # Exact match for expiration
        if payment.settling_attempts == merchant.dunning_settling_attempts:
            subscription.status = 'EXPIRED'
            subscription.save()
    
        # More urgent reminders every 4 attempts
        if payment.settling_attempts % 4 == 0:
            send_urgent_reminder_email()
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Failed Invoice Cleanup">
    **Function:** `process_failed_invoices()`

    **Purpose:** Cancel deliveries with long-expired payments to prevent infinite rescheduling.

    **Query Filters:**

    - Payment created \> `merchant.failed_payment_cancelled_days` ago (typically 20)
    - Delivery not completed
    - Payment not `authorized` or `settled`

    **Logic:**

    ```python
    def process_failed_invoices():
        days_threshold = merchant.failed_payment_cancelled_days
    
        old_failed_deliveries = delivery.objects.filter(
            order_id__payment_id__created__lte=now - timedelta(days=days_threshold),
            delivered=False
        ).exclude(
            order_id__payment_id__payment_status__in=['authorized', 'settled']
        )
    
        for delivery_item in old_failed_deliveries:
            delivery_item.cancelled = True
            delivery_item.save()
    
            delivery_item.payment_id.payment_status = 'CANCELLED'
            delivery_item.payment_id.save()
    
            # Unreserve stock
            unreserve_stock_for_order(delivery_item.order_id)
    ```

    **Why This Matters:**

    - Prevents zombie deliveries from being rescheduled indefinitely
    - Frees up reserved stock for other orders
    - Keeps delivery queue clean
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Date Range Strategy

<Info>
  **PAST_DUE Window:** Last 30 days to +14 days ensures:

  - Deliveries from the past month get retry attempts
  - Future deliveries within 14 days are prepared for payment
  - Old deliveries eventually get cancelled by `process_failed_invoices()`
</Info>

**ERROR Subscriptions:** No date filter - process all ERROR subscriptions regardless of delivery date. This is more aggressive to recover revenue.

## Stock Management Integration

Dunning integrates with Journey's stock management system to handle inventory correctly during payment retries.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Stock Reserved on Order Creation">
    When a subscription order is created, stock is automatically reserved:

    ```python
    # Reserve stock for upcoming delivery
    stock_movements = StockManager.reserve_stock_for_order(
        order=order_object,
        created_by=None
    )
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Stock Fulfilled on Payment Success">
    When payment settles, reserved stock is converted to fulfilled stock:

    ```python
    if payment.payment_status == 'SETTLED':
        stock_movements = StockManager.fulfill_order(
            order=order_object,
            created_by=None
        )
        # Reduces available stock, removes reservation
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Stock Unreserved on Payment Failure">
    When payment fails or is cancelled, stock reservation is released:

    ```python
    if payment.payment_status in ['FAILED', 'CANCELLED']:
        stock_movements = unreserve_stock_for_order(
            order=order_object,
            created_by=None
        )
        # Frees stock for other customers
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Stock Unreserved on Delivery Cancellation">
    When a delivery is cancelled after max attempts:

    ```python
    delivery_item.cancelled = True
    delivery_item.save()
    
    unreserve_stock_for_order(delivery_item.order_id)
    # Stock returned to available inventory
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Inventory Accuracy:** Proper stock management during dunning prevents overselling and ensures accurate inventory counts.
</Warning>

## Monitoring & Reporting

### Dunning Report

Access the live dunning report at `/dashboard/reports` → "Dunning subscriptions"

**Shows:**

- Subscription status (PAST_DUE or ERROR)
- Customer name and email
- Subscription ID (clickable link to admin)
- Number of settling attempts
- **Sorted by:** Settling attempts DESC (most urgent first)

**Use Cases:**

- Proactive customer outreach
- Identify subscriptions close to expiration
- Manual payment method updates via admin
- Customer success intervention

```sql
-- Query behind the dunning report
SELECT
    os.subscription_status,
    oc.full_name AS "Customer Name",
    oc.email AS "Customer Email",
    os.id AS "Subscription id",
    op.settling_attempts AS "Settling attempts"
FROM order_subscription os
JOIN order_customer oc ON oc.id = os.customer_id_id
JOIN order_order oo ON oo.subscription_id_id = os.id
JOIN order_payment op ON op.order_id_id = oo.id
WHERE os.subscription_status IN ('past_due', 'error')
  AND op.payment_status != 'cancelled'
ORDER BY op.settling_attempts DESC
```

### Cron Logging

All dunning execution is logged to `/var/log/cron.log`:

```log
[2025-10-16 08:00:00] payment-and-delivery.py started
[2025-10-16 08:00:15] ⚡ Processing tenant: venja
[2025-10-16 08:01:42] ⚡ Processing tenant: blomstra
[2025-10-16 08:02:03] [venja] Dunning failed: ConnectionError
[2025-10-16 08:05:22] payment-and-delivery.py completed
```

### Sentry Integration

All dunning errors are automatically captured to Sentry with context:

- Tenant schema name
- Function that failed
- Delivery/payment/subscription IDs
- Full stack trace
- Payment processor response

**Sentry Tags:**

```python
sentry_sdk.set_tag("tenant", connection.schema_name)
sentry_sdk.set_tag("function", "process_deliveries_with_error_subscription_status")
sentry_sdk.set_context("delivery", {
    "id": delivery_item.id,
    "subscription_id": delivery_item.subscription_id.id,
    "settling_attempts": payment.settling_attempts
})
```

## Merchant Configuration

Each merchant can customize dunning behavior via the admin interface.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="dunning_settling_attempts">
    **Field:** `merchant.dunning_settling_attempts`

    **Default:** 20

    **Description:** Maximum number of retry attempts before subscription expires.

    **Configuration:**

    ```python
    # Typical values:
    15 attempts = ~2 weeks
    20 attempts = ~3 weeks (default)
    25 attempts = ~3.5 weeks
    30 attempts = ~1 month
    ```

    **Impact:**

    - Higher value = More recovery opportunities, longer retry period
    - Lower value = Faster expiration, cleaner subscriber list

    **Recommendation:** 20 attempts balances recovery rate with customer experience.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="failed_payment_cancelled_days">
    **Field:** `merchant.failed_payment_cancelled_days`

    **Default:** 20

    **Description:** Days before failed deliveries are automatically cancelled.

    **Configuration:**

    ```python
    # Should match dunning_settling_attempts roughly
    failed_payment_cancelled_days = 20
    dunning_settling_attempts = 20
    ```

    **Impact:**

    - Prevents infinite delivery rescheduling
    - Cleans up zombie deliveries
    - Frees reserved stock

    **Recommendation:** Set to same value as `dunning_settling_attempts`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Email Templates">
    Customize dunning email templates in the admin interface at `/admin/communication/message/`.

    **Key Templates:**

    1. **PAST_DUE First Time** - Friendly insufficient funds notice
    2. **ERROR First Time** - Urgent payment method update request
    3. **Every 4th Attempt** - Progressive urgency reminders
    4. **EXPIRED** - Final cancellation notice

    **Template Variables:**

    - `{{ customer_object.full_name }}`
    - `{{ merchant_object.name }}`
    - `{{ delivery_object.delivery_date }}`
    - `{{ subscription_object.id }}`
    - Custom context variables
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="For Merchants">
    **Monitor the Dunning Report Weekly:**

    - Review subscriptions with 10+ attempts
    - Proactively call high-value customers at risk
    - Offer payment plan or pause option

    **Test Your Email Templates:**

    - Send test emails to yourself
    - Check mobile rendering
    - Verify links work correctly
    - A/B test subject lines

    **Set Appropriate Thresholds:**

    - Higher-value subscriptions → More attempts (25-30)
    - Lower-value subscriptions → Fewer attempts (15-20)
    - Consider customer acquisition cost (CAC)

    **Offer Multiple Payment Methods:**

    - Credit cards
    - Debit cards
    - Bank transfers
    - Digital wallets (Apple Pay, Google Pay)

    **Customer Communication:**

    - Train support team on dunning process
    - Provide self-service payment method update
    - Offer pause instead of cancel
    - Consider win-back campaigns for EXPIRED
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="For Developers">
    **Error Handling:**

    - Always wrap payment calls in try/except
    - Log all failures to Sentry
    - Don't let one failure stop batch processing
    - Use `@exception_via_slack` decorator for critical functions

    **Testing:**

    - Test with all three payment processors (Rapyd, Reepay, Straumur)
    - Simulate insufficient funds (response code 51)
    - Simulate card declines
    - Test expiration at exact threshold
    - Verify stock unreservation

    **Performance:**

    - Index `payment.settling_attempts` column
    - Index `subscription.subscription_status` column
    - Optimize queries with proper joins
    - Use tenant context correctly

    **Monitoring:**

    - Set up Sentry alerts for dunning failures
    - Monitor recovery rate (settled after failure)
    - Track average attempts to recovery
    - Alert on processing time \> 10 minutes
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Recovery Optimization">
    **Timing Strategy:**

    - Retry after 8 AM (customer may have deposited paycheck)
    - Avoid weekends for initial failures (check deposit timing)
    - Consider payday schedules (1st and 15th)

    **Communication Strategy:**

    - First email: Informative, not urgent
    - 4th attempt: Gentle reminder
    - 8th attempt: Moderate urgency
    - 12th+ attempts: High urgency
    - 16th+ attempts: Final warning

    **Payment Method Flexibility:**

    - Allow customers to update payment method themselves
    - Accept multiple backup payment methods
    - Automatically try backup method after primary fails
    - Notify when card is expiring (before it fails)

    **Incentive Strategy (Optional):**

    - Small discount for updating payment method
    - Free delivery if resolved within 3 days
    - Loyalty points for maintaining active status
    - Win-back offers for EXPIRED subscriptions
